# StepMorotControlUnit

The goal was to make an electric device for control of the step motor. The step motor was used for manipulation with sample holder inside the vacuum chamber. A controller supports continuous rotation in both directions and changing the position at given frequency, angle and given amount of times.

The step motor is operated in a bipolar mode. The step motor driver based on L298N integrated circuit is responsible for power amplification. The dissipated power of the step motor is about 10 W. Driving pulses are generated by the Arduino Nano board. The visualisation of setting is implemented using 20x4 LCD display.

## Highlights
* Rotation speed and direction adjustment.
* Operation in a stepping mode: table is periodically rotated by a given angle.
* Involved designing, soldering, assembling and programming.
## Used frameworks and programming languages
Arduino C
